* StandardNN: knn with the standard training process
* ATNN: Training with original training data and adversarial example(with the fixed scale of perturbation)
* ADVNN: Training with adversarial examples(with different amount of perturbation) and the labels are generated by query victim knn

The accuracy is reported under testing set
